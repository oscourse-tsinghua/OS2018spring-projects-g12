I find two test case in reference about stdio.

The fist one is fclose-loop, test if file can be close. 
.c & .testspecs file is in tolerate path
It passed!

The second one is 64bit, test the io function of ucore.
I alloc a char array like this:
	char buf[10] = "hello";
Page fault happend when I visit buf[i], i from 1 to 9;
I guess ucore does not alloc a memory for buf
Maybe it is not a bug
But I think ucore should implement this access to alloc
